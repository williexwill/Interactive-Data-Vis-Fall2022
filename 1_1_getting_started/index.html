    <h1>This is not a site.</h1>
    <h3>This is not a page.</h3>
    <p>This is a simulacrum made by machines designed to translate human intention into equations, then back into visually interpretable symbols. This is an abstraction of an abstraction of an abstraction.
    </p> 
    <h3>This is not cyberspace. </h3>
    <p>This is servers and computers, switches and wires, electrical power and cooling systems,  silicon, glass, lithium, copper, and petroleum. This is material and physical.</p>
    </p> 
    <h3>This is not finished.</h3>
    <p>This is not permanent. This is not static. This is not discrete. This is not infinite. This is not contained. This is not secure. This is not private. This is not public. This is not a site.</br>
