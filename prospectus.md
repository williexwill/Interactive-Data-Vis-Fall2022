## Who says big government is bad? Examining the social impact of the state as employer. 
A point of interest and research in my graduate studies has been the development, ownership, and governance of technology and technical systems. As part of that work I’ve been interested in the role of the state and public ownership of infrastructure, vs. the role of private profit-seeking interests. When reviewing the Census data I noticed that the economic data collected includes public employment numbers. Since I’m already interested in the interaction between public and private sectors, this data piqued my interest. 

Using that employment data, I’d like to ask (and answer) this broad question: What social effects do rates of public employment have over time?

Some of the factors I might examine in relation to public employment rates are:
- Poverty/income levels 
- Overall wages
- Life expectancy
- GDP/broader economic health
- Political party affiliation/governance
- Economic inequality (if I can find data that measures this)

My suspicion is that states that have lower rates of public employment, likely also lean Republican. My further suspicion is that lower rates of public employment, translate roughly to the lack of provision of government services, and the implementation of privatization and austerity measures. I suspect further that these measures might have negative external effects. But, we’ll have to see what the data shows.  

I am envisioning a narrative project with a geographic element that examines trends since the 1970s in either two comprable sized states (by population) with dramatic differences in public employment rates, or possibly looking at nation trends then breaking it down by states. I plan on including small multiples, with likely a heavy reliance on line graphs and some maps.
